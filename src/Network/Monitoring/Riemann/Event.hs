Module      : Network.Monitoring.Riemann.Event
Description : A module for building Riemann events

Build an event which can then be sent to Riemann using a 'Network.Monitoring.Riemann.Client.Client'

Events are built by composing helper functions that set Riemann fields and applying to one of the Event constructors:

@
  E.ok "my service"
& E.description "my description"
& E.metric (length [ "some data" ])
& E.ttl 20
& E.tags ["tag1", "tag2"]
@

With this design you are encouraged to create an event with one of 'E.ok', 'E.warn' or 'E.failure'.

This has been done because we found that it is best to avoid services like @my.service.success@ and @my.service.error@ (that's what the Riemann state field is for).

You can use your own states using @E.info & E.state "trace"@ however this is discouraged as it doesn't show up nicely in riemann-dash.

    Note that since Riemann's protocol has separate types for integers, floats and doubles, you need to specify which
    type you are using. For example, this won't work:

    @
    metric 1 myEvent
    @

    Instead use:

    @
    metric (1 :: Int) myEvent
    @
